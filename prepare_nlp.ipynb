       "'In our blog, “The Best Path To A Career In Software Development,” we looked at how bootcamps provide a more direct path to a career than traditional undergraduate CS degree programs. Today we’re here to talk to you about how bootcamps provide a more direct path to a career in data science than a Master’s Degree.\\xa0\\n“But don’t I need a degree to get a job as a data scientist?” As a non-traditional educational model, we hear this concern a lot. The answer is yes and no. Yes, because most jobs in data science require some form of higher education. No, because that degree doesn’t have to be in something related to data science – data scientists have degrees in many different areas of study! So if the concern that lacking a piece of paper will prevent you from accelerating your career, fear no more.\\nWhile a Master’s Degree provides a lot of value, it isn’t the most direct path for a job. With the exponential growth in data generation and the race to keep up with storing and processing that data, data science no longer sits at the fringe of an ultra-specialized workforce. Companies now need much larger teams to analyze, model, and leverage the data they’ve collected. So while the field of data science might have once only been available to those skilled in highly academic algorithm development, it’s now a playground for those with some Python skills who know how to find valuable insights in a mess of data.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nNow let’s get a bit more specific. If modern roles in data science demand more practical skills, why is a bootcamp a better path?\\n\\xa0\\n#1: Responsive curriculum: Barely 10 years ago nobody had heard of data science. But in that short amount of time, the tools and technologies in the field have grown exponentially. Each year sees the introduction of new packages, visualization tools, and cutting edge technologies. With such a rapidly evolving landscape, it’s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. With our ears tuned directly to employers, we’re able to adapt quickly and ensure we’re teaching what hiring managers need.\\n\\xa0\\n#2 Hands-on Project-Based Learning: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduced amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn’t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. A career in data science is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n#3 Progressive Curriculum Structure: In a traditional degree, students study by taking several classes at a time. You may begin with data structures and algorithms, then move to SQL, then take Python, and so on. But real-world data science doesn’t work so neatly. You will never face a project where you’re only working with one of those tools, so this pedagogical method is misaligned with career demands. Our program focuses on real-world deliverables at every step of the journey, while exposing you to increasingly complex problems and projects. You start off applying basic tools to simple challenges. Then, we begin varying the data sets, the way you access that data, the type of methodology you use, and the deliverable you’re responsible for. To put it simply, the structure of a traditional degree teaches you how to use a hammer, a saw, and a chisel. Codeup teaches you how to build a stool, a birdbox, and a sculpture with those tools, and when to use which.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n#4 Job Placement Services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you’re in the right place. Most graduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n#5 Messy Data: This is probably the most important difference between us and traditional degrees. We use real, messy, misleading, broken data so you learn how to draw insights from the real thing. Unfortunately, that is not the norm. Because of the segmented class structure, traditional degrees have to focus on using data that teach one specific skill. At Codeup, you’re always applying your tools to a real deliverable, so we’re able to use real data sets that intersect the challenges of multiple skills.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nLastly, we encourage you to think about the return on your investment in your education.\\n\\n\\n\\nCodeup*\\nPrivate Master’s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$29,500\\n6 months\\n85% graduation rate\\n88%\\xa0 employment rate\\n$67,500 median starting salary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$62,280\\n18-24 months\\n61% graduation rate\\n72.5% employment rate\\n$59,866 median starting salary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*read more on our outcomes\\n\\xa0\\nMost importantly, the opportunity cost of pursuing a master’s degree is equal to 13-19 months of employment. At a median salary of $67,500 from Codeup, that’s between $67,500-$101,250 in foregone earnings.\\xa0\\nSo, you want a career in data science? A career accelerator like Codeup is the path for you. Still not convinced? We’re here to hear your concerns – contact us and let’s talk it through.\\n\\n'"

       "'in our blog the best path to a career in software development we looked at how bootcamps provide a more direct path to a career than traditional undergraduate c degree program today were here to talk to you about how bootcamps provide a more direct path to a career in data science than a master degree but dont i need a degree to get a job a a data scientist a a nontraditional educational model we hear this concern a lot the answer is yes and no yes because most job in data science require some form of higher education no because that degree doesnt have to be in something related to data science data scientist have degree in many different area of study so if the concern that lacking a piece of paper will prevent you from accelerating your career fear no more while a master degree provides a lot of value it isnt the most direct path for a job with the exponential growth in data generation and the race to keep up with storing and processing that data data science no longer sits at the fringe of an ultraspecialized workforce company now need much larger team to analyze model and leverage the data theyve collected so while the field of data science might have once only been available to those skilled in highly academic algorithm development it now a playground for those with some python skill who know how to find valuable insight in a mess of data now let get a bit more specific if modern role in data science demand more practical skill why is a bootcamp a better path 1 responsive curriculum barely 10 year ago nobody had heard of data science but in that short amount of time the tool and technology in the field have grown exponentially each year see the introduction of new package visualization tool and cutting edge technology with such a rapidly evolving landscape it hard for traditional learning environment to keep pace with our ear tuned directly to employer were able to adapt quickly and ensure were teaching what hiring manager need 2 handson projectbased learning have you ever watched top chef or the great british bake off you were probably pretty entertained but how did that seared ahi tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduced amusebouche turn out the sad reality is watching expert do their thing doesnt make you an expert nor doe listening to lecture our program is built around the concept of praxis which is essentially the practical application of theory or the blending of theory and practice half of your 670 program hour are spent actually writing code so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming a career in data science is like an oldtime trade like becoming a blacksmith you have to learn from master and practice practice practice 3 progressive curriculum structure in a traditional degree student study by taking several class at a time you may begin with data structure and algorithm then move to sql then take python and so on but realworld data science doesnt work so neatly you will never face a project where youre only working with one of those tool so this pedagogical method is misaligned with career demand our program focus on realworld deliverable at every step of the journey while exposing you to increasingly complex problem and project you start off applying basic tool to simple challenge then we begin varying the data set the way you access that data the type of methodology you use and the deliverable youre responsible for to put it simply the structure of a traditional degree teach you how to use a hammer a saw and a chisel codeup teach you how to build a stool a birdbox and a sculpture with those tool and when to use which 4 job placement service if education is your goal stop reading now if a career is your goal then youre in the right place most graduate institution have career service office where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fair but codeup make you a promise get a job after graduation or get 100 of your money back there are no two way about that our singular focus is your outcome unlike traditional institution we sell job not education 5 messy data this is probably the most important difference between u and traditional degree we use real messy misleading broken data so you learn how to draw insight from the real thing unfortunately that is not the norm because of the segmented class structure traditional degree have to focus on using data that teach one specific skill at codeup youre always applying your tool to a real deliverable so were able to use real data set that intersect the challenge of multiple skill lastly we encourage you to think about the return on your investment in your education codeup private master 29500 6 month 85 graduation rate 88 employment rate 67500 median starting salary 62280 1824 month 61 graduation rate 725 employment rate 59866 median starting salary read more on our outcome most importantly the opportunity cost of pursuing a master degree is equal to 1319 month of employment at a median salary of 67500 from codeup thats between 67500101250 in foregone earnings so you want a career in data science a career accelerator like codeup is the path for you still not convinced were here to hear your concern contact u and let talk it through'"
